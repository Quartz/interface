# ðŸŒˆ Prism UI

Prism UI is a React-based component library. It is part of the Prism design system for [Quartz](https://qz.com/). The goal of this library is to centralize and document the building blocks of our web front-end. By doing this we hope to:

1. Make front-end web development easier by improving reusability.
2. Provide a more consistent, performant, and accessible experience for Quartz readers.

You can browse Prism UI components in Storybook at [prism.qz.com](https://prism.qz.com). Each Storybook component has a Docs tab, which displays the componentâ€™s documentation, and a Canvas tab, which allows previewing the component in different contexts.

## _This site is public!_

Prism UI is intended as a resource for the product team at Quartz, but it is publicly viewable by anyone inside or outside of Quartz. As such, please be mindful of including sensitive information in _any_ branch, issue, or pull request.

## Support

We welcome feedback, bug reports, and proposals using the [Github issues page](https://github.com/Quartz/interface/issues).
