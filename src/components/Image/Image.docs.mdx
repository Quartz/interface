# Image

Displays an image. The `Image` component requires `fallbackHeight` and `fallbackWidth` to set aspect ratio and `sizes` and `srcSet` to provide [responsive rendering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images). They will not be calculated for you and there are no default values. Future components may provide a simpler implementation for specific use cases.

This component does not provide [art direction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture), which is also a task for a future component.

## Usage

```js
import { Image } from '@quartz/interface/src/components';
```

## Props

<Props of={Image} />

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** use a container to constrain the size or shape of the image. An `Image` will always expand or contract to fit the width of its container. The `Image` component purposefully does not accept a `className` prop.
- **Do** understand that the `fallbackHeight` and `fallbackWidth` props are [used to set aspect ratio and help the browser reserve space](https://blog.logrocket.com/jank-free-page-loading-with-media-aspect-ratios/) for the image during initial layout.
- **Do** [provide useful alt text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/) for your images. Sometimes, an empty string is the most useful!
- **Do** learn why and how to use [responsive rendering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images). Itâ€™s important to understand how `sizes` and `srcSet` work.
- **Do** think when and whether this component might be rendered on AMP pages and pass the correct `amp` prop.
- **Do not** avoid the `Image` component by using the HTML `img` tag. The `Image` component enforces best practices and performant rendering.
- **Do not** use the `Image` component for SVGs. Instead, import SVGs and render them directly with React.

## Examples

### An image constrained to 400px

<Preview>
  <Story id="image--constrained" />
</Preview>

### An image constrained to 200px and reshaped to be round

<Preview>
  <Story id="image--reshaped" />
</Preview>
