# Kicker

A kicker is a short phrase that accompanies the [hed](/?path=/docs/hed--small#hed) of a story or unit of content. This component is not exported for direct use; instead, it is composed into other components that provide information about a story.

Interestingly, the word ”kicker” is [undergoing some change](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/kicker-definition-meaning) even within journalism circles, so it’s not uncommon to encounter someone who is confused by how we employ ”kickers” at Quartz.
