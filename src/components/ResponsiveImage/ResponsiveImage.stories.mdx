# ResponsiveImage

A wrapper for the Image component that automatically generates a `srcset` value based on the provided image URL (`src`) and a range of image widths (`widthRange`).

There are two valid use-cases for the `ResponsiveImage` component:

1. An image that will be served at fixed dimensions, but which will offer higher-resolution versions for users with high PPI displays, such as Apple’s Retina Displays.
1. An image whose size will be determined by the user’s viewport. We use the `widthRange` prop to specify the upper and lower limits of the image's potential widths, and the `size` prop to help the browser choose which image resolution is most appropriate.


## Usage guidelines

- **Do** use the `ResponsiveImage` for an image whose aspect ratio will not change.
- **Do** supply an image URL that supports resizing via the `w` and `h` URL query parameters.
- **Do** supply alt text for non-decorative images.
- **Do** describe the image slot's behavior via the `sizes` prop, when you expect it to change with the viewport dimensions.

## Examples

### Fixed width

By providing a pixel value in the `sizes` prop, we tell the browser that the image slot will always stay the same size.

Additionally, we should provide this value as both the minimum and maximum widths in `widthRange`. The component will automatically generate high PPI versions by doubling the maximum value.

<Canvas>
	<Story
		args={{
			alt: 'An animated gif showing James Franco in The Disaster Artist (2017)',
			fallbackWidth: 240,
			fallbackHeight: 120,
			sizes: '240px',
			src: 'https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/giphy-32.gif',
			widthRange: [ 240, 240 ],
		}}
		name="Fixed"
	>
		{
			args => (
				<div style={{ width: 240 }}>
					<ResponsiveImage {...args} />
				</div>
			)
		}
	</Story>
</Canvas>

### Fluid width

For image slots whose dimensions will be derived from the viewport size, we must roughly describe this behavior in the `sizes` prop to help the browser choose the most appropriate image from the `srcset`.

In the following example, the image container width is set to `50vw` (50% of the viewport width) with a max-width of `640px`. The container will therefore reach its max-width when the viewport is `1280px` wide (`640/0.5`). We can express this in our `sizes` prop as `(max-width: 1280px) 50vw, 620px`.

<Canvas>
	<Story
		args={{
			alt: 'A 2020 Porsche Taycan is driven into a tunnel with a city skyline in the background',
			fallbackWidth: 620,
			fallbackHeight: 320,
			sizes: '(max-width: 1280px) 50vw, 620px',
			src: 'https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PORSCHE-620x360-sponsoredcontent-1.png',
			widthRange: [ 300, 620 ],
		}}
		name="Cropped2"
	>
		{
			args => (
				<div style={{ width: '50vw', maxWidth: 620 }}>
					<ResponsiveImage {...args} />
				</div>
			)
		}
	</Story>
</Canvas>

In the following example, the image slot width will always be 100% of its container, which in Storybook is more-or-less the width of the viewport until the application container element reaches its max-width at 1300 pixels wide, at which point the image container is about 960px wide. We can therefore describe this behavior as `(max-width: 1300px) 90vw, 960px`.

<Canvas>
	<Story
		args={{
			alt: 'The Apple Inc. logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in New York',
			fallbackWidth: 960,
			fallbackHeight: 638,
			sizes: '(max-width: 1300px) 90vw, 960px',
			src: 'https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-12T095922Z_142848263_RC2XGJ9T1J4Y_RTRMADP_3_APPLE-IPHONE-5G.jpg?quality=80&strip=all',
			widthRange: [ 300, 960 ],
		}}
		name="Cropped1"
	>
		{args => <ResponsiveImage {...args} />}
	</Story>
