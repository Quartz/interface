# ResponsiveImage

A wrapper for the Image component that automatically generates a `srcset` value based on the provided image URL (`src`) and a range of image widths (`widthRange`). Use this component to display an image at the most appropriate resolution based on the conditions in the user's browser.

There are two reasons you may want to use this component:

1. You have an image that will be served at set dimensions (fixed width), but you want to offer higher-resolution versions for users with high PPI displays, such as Apple’s Retina Displays.
1. You have an image whose size will be determined by the user’s viewport (fluid width). We use the `widthRange` prop to specify the upper and lower bounds of the image's potential widths, and the `size` prop to help the browser choose the largest image it needs.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** use the `ResponsiveImage` for an image whose aspect ratio will not change.
- **Do** supply an image URL that supports resizing via the `w` and `h` URL query parameters.
- **Do** supply alt text for non-decorative images.
- **Do** describe the image slot's behavior via the `sizes` prop, when you expect it to change with the viewport dimensions.
- **Do not** omit the `sizes` prop if the image’s dimensions will be derived from the viewport dimensions.
- **Do not** replicate the exact CSS media queries of the image slot in `sizes`. Often a simple expression is best, such as `(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw` (meaning, when the browser window is wider than 768px, this image is probably going to be displayed about half the size of that. If it’s smaller, it’ll probably be full-width).

## Examples

### Fixed width

By providing a pixel value in the `sizes` prop, we tell the browser that the image slot will always stay the same size.

Additionally, we should provide this value as both the minimum and maximum widths in `widthRange`. The component will automatically generate high PPI versions by doubling the maximum value.

<Canvas>
	<Story
		args={{
			alt: 'An animated gif showing James Franco in The Disaster Artist (2017)',
			fallbackWidth: 240,
			fallbackHeight: 120,
			sizes: '240px',
			src: 'https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/giphy-32.gif',
			widthRange: [ 240, 240 ],
		}}
		name="Fixed"
	>
		{
			args => (
				<div style={{ width: 240 }}>
					<ResponsiveImage {...args} />
				</div>
			)
		}
	</Story>
</Canvas>

### Fluid width

For image slots whose dimensions will be derived from the viewport size, we must roughly describe this behavior in the `sizes` prop to help the browser choose the most appropriate image from the `srcset`.

In the following example, the image container width is set to `50vw` (50% of the viewport width) with a max-width of `640px`. The container will therefore reach its max-width when the viewport is `1280px` wide (`640/0.5`). We can express this in our `sizes` prop as `(max-width: 1280px) 50vw, 620px`.

<Canvas>
	<Story
		args={{
			alt: 'A 2020 Porsche Taycan is driven into a tunnel with a city skyline in the background',
			fallbackWidth: 620,
			fallbackHeight: 320,
			sizes: '(max-width: 1280px) 50vw, 620px',
			src: 'https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PORSCHE-620x360-sponsoredcontent-1.png',
			widthRange: [ 300, 620 ],
		}}
		name="Cropped2"
	>
		{
			args => (
				<div style={{ width: '50vw', maxWidth: 620 }}>
					<ResponsiveImage {...args} />
				</div>
			)
		}
	</Story>
</Canvas>

In the following example, the image slot width will always be 100% of its container, which in Storybook is more-or-less the width of the viewport (let’s call it 90vw) until the application container element reaches its max-width at 1300 pixels wide, at which point the image container will be fixed at 960px wide. We can therefore describe this behavior as `(max-width: 1300px) 90vw, 960px`.

<Canvas>
	<Story
		args={{
			alt: 'The Apple Inc. logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in New York',
			fallbackWidth: 960,
			fallbackHeight: 638,
			sizes: '(max-width: 1300px) 90vw, 960px',
			src: 'https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-12T095922Z_142848263_RC2XGJ9T1J4Y_RTRMADP_3_APPLE-IPHONE-5G.jpg?quality=80&strip=all',
			widthRange: [ 300, 960 ],
		}}
		name="Cropped1"
	>
		{args => <ResponsiveImage {...args} />}
	</Story>
</Canvas>
