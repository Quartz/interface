# WPResponsiveImage

A wrapper for the Image component that automatically generates a `srcset` value based on the provided WordPress image URL (`src`) and a range of image widths (`widthRange`).

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** use the `WPResponsiveImage` for an image whose aspect ratio will not change.
- **Do** supply an image URL that supports resizing via the `w` and `h` URL query parameters.
- **Do** supply alt text for non-decorative images.
- **Do not** use the `WPResponsiveImage` for an image whose aspect ratio changes between breakpoints (use an art direction solution instead, e.g., `<picture>`). You can read more about the difference between responsive images and art direction on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)
